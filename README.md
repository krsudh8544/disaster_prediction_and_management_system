# disaster_prediction_and_management_system
Description:- Utilizes various data sources like weather , geographical data, and historical incidents to predict potential natural disasters and manage response. 
Skills Required:- Data analytics, machine learning and geographical information systems 
Impact:- Illustrate your ability to handle large and complex data sets to address vital societal challenges.

System Overview
The system will:

Collect GIS Data (from files or APIs)
Process Data (using statistical methods in C)
Predict Digester Efficiency (using a simple machine learning algorithm)
Manage Digester Operations (track parameters like temperature, pH, and gas production)

Explanation of Code
Reads Data: Loads temperature, pH, and gas production from a file.
Processes Data: Computes averages and applies simple linear regression.
Predicts Output: Estimates gas production based on input parameters.
User Input: Accepts real-time temperature and pH values.
This is a simplified version. You can expand it by integrating GIS data (using libraries like GDAL in C) and more advanced machine learning models (using external ML libraries). Would you like additional features like GIS mapping or sensor integration?
